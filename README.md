# nsjson

Takes .nsjson file types and converts them to json.
Right now it only removes comments and trailing commas but there are more plans set for the future.

#### to use:
1. make a .nsjson file 
2. add valid json and add comments using `// ...` (trailing commas allowed)
3. open nsjson and use the `compile /path/to/file.nsjson`
